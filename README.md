# Outdated Codes Repo.
[简体中文](https://github.com/JNSMS-VexRoboticsAssociation/Outdated-Codes/blob/main/README_cn.md)

The repository of messy and rotten outdated code left by seniors.(To be honest)

All codes here have been refactored or will be refactored in the future.

If you have leisure or just for fun, the table here details the functions of the codes in each branch for your reference. But remember that the implementation here has little reference value.

| Branch             | Function                                           |
